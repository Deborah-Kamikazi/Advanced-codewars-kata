## Simple Pig Latin
```
Description:
Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.

Examples
pigIt('Pig latin is cool'); // igPay atinlay siay oolcay
pigIt('Hello world !');     // elloHay orldway !
```
## Proof Read
```
You've just finished writing the last chapter for your novel when a virus suddenly infects your document. It has swapped the 'i's and 'e's in 'ei' words and capitalised random letters. Write a function which will:

a) remove the spelling errors in 'ei' words. (Example of 'ei' words: their, caffeine, deceive, weight)

b) only capitalise the first letter of each sentence. Make sure the rest of the sentence is in lower case.

Example: He haD iEght ShOTs of CAffIEne. --> He had eight shots of caffeine.
```
## CamelCase Method
```
Write a method (or function, depending on the language) that converts a string to camelCase, that is, all words must have their first letter capitalized and spaces must be removed.

Examples (input --> output):
"hello case" --> "HelloCase"
"camel case word" --> "CamelCaseWord"

## Moving Zeros To The End
```
Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
